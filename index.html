        <h1>Performing Hajj-2022 </h1>
        <p>About 1 million Muslim pilgrims are visiting Mecca for the first hajj since 2019 without strict pandemic
          restrictions.
          According to the Quran, all Muslims capable of going on the hajj should do so at least once in their
          lifetimes,
          after 280 years, celebrated hajj on Jumma day, hence it's called Hajj–e-Akbar</p>
